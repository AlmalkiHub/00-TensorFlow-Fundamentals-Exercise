# 00-TensorFlow-Fundamentals-Exercise

In this exercise I did the following: 
- Created a vector, scalar, matrix and tensor with values of my choosing using tf.constant().
- Found the shape, rank and size of the tensors I created in 1.
- Created two tensors containing random values between 0 and 1 with shape [5, 300].
- Multiplied the two tensors I created in 3 using matrix multiplication.
- Multiplied the two tensors I created in 3 using dot product.
- Created a tensor with random values between 0 and 1 with shape [224, 224, 3].
- Found the min and max values of the tensor I created in 6 along the first axis.
- Created a tensor with random values of shape [1, 224, 224, 3] then squeezed it to change the shape to [224, 224, 3].
- Created a tensor with shape [10] using my own choice of values, then found the index which has the maximum value. One-hot encoded the tensor I created in 9.
